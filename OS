ADS
a png is a picture, but it also has metadata in other streams. files can be attached to other files in other streams and ran when opening it. WinDefender 
does check these however
$data has the stream, saving a file to a thumbdrive removes the other streams
ads - set-content .\file.txt -value ""
read it - get-item -stream <name> or cat <file> -stream <name>i
