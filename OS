ADS
a png is a picture, but it also has metadata in other streams. files can be attached to other files in 
other streams and ran when opening it. 
WinDefender does check ads's however
$data has the stream, saving a file to a thumbdrive removes the other streams
ads - set-content .\file.txt -value ""
read it - get-item -stream <name> or cat <file> -stream <name>i

LINUX PROCS (cronjob, zombie and orphan procs, services)


procs after startup
[kthreadd] (PID = 2) #all kernel procs are forked from here. Typicaly handle hardware, managde by kernel. 
they also are usually in [] and have PPID of 2
/sbin/init (PID = 1) #all user procs are forked from here or direct ancestor
pri is priority
ni procs nice number

euid defines the access rights for a process.
A second user ID, the real user ID (ruid), indicates who initiated a process.
Users can only modify / interact with files /process that they own or have been shared with them.
A user is an entity that can run processes and own files.

system calls are interactions between procs and kernel
fork() makes a proc by duping it, exec() makes the kernel replace the process

'crontab -u [user] file’ - sets users crontab file to the contents of listed file

‘crontab -l -u [user]’ - Displays user’s crontab contents

‘crontab -r -u [user]’ - Removes user’s crontab contents

‘crontab -e -u [user]’ - edits user’s crontab contents

crontab jobs run with the permissions of the owner of the crontab file

Recycle Bin

When a user deletes a file in Windows it goes into the Recycle bin. This data is recoverable during an investigation using built in tools.
Content in the recycle bin is identified by:

SID - determines which user deleted it
Timestamp - When it was deleted
$RXXXXXX - content of deleted files (important)
$IXXXXXX - original PATH and name (Important)

Location: C:\$Recycle.bin (Hidden System Folder)

Get-Childitem 'C:\$RECYCLE.BIN' -Recurse -Verbose -Force | select FullName
Output shows all of the contents of the Recycle Bin. -Recurse will look at all user’s/SID’s contents

Reads the contents of a particular file within the Recycle BIN

Prefetch
Prefetch files are created by the windows operating system when an application is run from a specific location for the first time.
Location: C:\Windows\Prefetch
