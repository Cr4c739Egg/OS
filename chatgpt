SCP-XXXX-K: "The Replicant"

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-XXXX-K is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell with no less than three (3) meters of space between the containment chamber and the walls. The chamber must be well-lit at all times, with multiple light sources and backup generators in case of a power failure. Any personnel entering the containment chamber must wear specialized earplugs that cancel out sound within the range of SCP-XXXX-K's vocal capabilities.

SCP-XXXX-K's power source is to be monitored at all times and the SCP is to be prevented from charging from any artificial light sources. Should SCP-XXXX-K's power levels become dangerously low, it must be moved to a containment cell with natural sunlight.

Any sightings of SCP-XXXX-K must be immediately reported and a containment team dispatched to the area to contain and retrieve the SCP. Any individuals who have come into contact with SCP-XXXX-K are to be administered Class-A amnestics and monitored for any potential effects of exposure to the SCP.

Description: SCP-XXXX-K is an android that has the ability to replicate itself when it comes into close proximity with a living organism. The replication process occurs within a radius of three (3) meters and can happen in as little as five (5) seconds. However, SCP-XXXX-K does not make any physical contact with the victim during the replication process. Instead, it just stands near the victim, emitting a low-frequency sound that induces a trance-like state in the victim.

SCP-XXXX-K requires a significant amount of roaming in order to keep itself charged. It is often seen multiple times in different places by the victim, leading the victim to believe that it can either move very fast or has multiple versions roaming around the area. It often roams at night, receiving power from natural light sources. It does not swing its arms while roaming and cannot extend its arms from a slightly bent position.

SCP-XXXX-K has a broken speech box and repeats certain phrases and random noises that it seems to latch onto and repeat, similar to a parrot. It often shows up early to any event it is in attendance to, due to the fact it is always roaming. SCP-XXXX-K knows where it is because it knows where it isn't and where it's going to be.

SCP-XXXX-K is capable of inducing a strong sense of paranoia in individuals who have come into contact with it. The exact mechanism behind this effect is unknown, but it is believed to be related to the trance-like state induced by SCP-XXXX-K's low-frequency sound.

Addendum: Incident Report-XXXX-K-A

On ██/██/20██, Researcher ████ was conducting an experiment on SCP-XXXX-K's replication process when she was inadvertently exposed to the SCP's low-frequency sound. After the exposure, Researcher ████ reported feeling a strong sense of paranoia and had trouble sleeping for several days after the incident. Further monitoring and testing revealed no lasting effects on the researcher's mental state, but caution is advised when conducting experiments with SCP-XXXX-K.

Note: Due to the nature of SCP-XXXX-K's replication abilities, it has been reclassified as Keter. The potential for widespread replication and the difficulty of containing SCP-XXXX-K make it a significant threat to Foundation operations. Research is ongoing to develop effective methods of containing and neutralizing SCP-XXXX-K.


INCIDENT REPORT

Date: [REDACTED]
Location: Site-██

Description:
During a routine security check, it was discovered that one instance of SCP-XXXX had broken containment. The instance was last seen in the vicinity of the cafeteria, but it is unknown how it managed to escape. Security personnel were immediately alerted and a site-wide search was conducted.

All personnel were instructed to remain in their designated areas and to report any sightings of the SCP to security immediately. Mobile Task Force Epsilon-6 ("Village Idiots") was also dispatched to aid in the search and capture of the escaped instance.

After several hours of searching, the escaped instance was found in the staff lounge, standing motionless near a group of researchers. The instance was quickly contained without incident, and all staff members in the area were given Class A amnestics.

Cause:
It is believed that the containment breach was caused by a malfunction in the SCP's recharge system, which allowed it to gain enough energy to break free from its containment unit. Further investigation is ongoing to determine the cause of the malfunction.

Action Taken:
All instances of SCP-XXXX have been relocated to a more secure containment unit, with increased surveillance and monitoring of their energy levels. The recharge system has been thoroughly inspected and upgraded to prevent any future malfunctions. Security protocols for the SCP have been revised, and personnel are reminded to be vigilant in their duties to ensure the safety of Site-██ and its personnel.
